        <h3 id="about">About Me</h3>
        <p>
          My name is Luke Chidinma Victory. I am someone who values growth,
          creativity, and purpose. I enjoy learning new things, exploring ideas,
          and expressing myself through thoughtful work and storytelling. I
          believe that every experience, whether easy or challenging, plays a
          role in shaping who we become. I am driven by curiosity and a desire
          to make a positive impact, both through knowledge and meaningful
          connections with others. I take pride in being reflective,
          open-minded, and determined to improve myself consistently. Above all,
          I strive to stay true to my values while working toward my goals and
          becoming the best version of myself.

        <h3 id="work">Work</h3>
        <p>
          I am an aspiring software developer with a strong interest in
          technology and problem-solving. I enjoy learning how things work
          behind the scenes and using code to turn ideas into functional,
          meaningful solutions. Technology fascinates me because of its power to
          improve lives, simplify tasks, and create new opportunities.
